# Data Mining Project 1

In this project, we implemented 5 clustering methods: K-means, HAC, DBSCAN, GMM, Spectral.

# The project includes 7 python files

Main.py - Run this file to see how the 5 methods generate clusters, the plot result, and the rand index score. Examples of running each clustering methods we implemented can be found in main(). We use sklearn adjusted_rand_score to give the rand index as an external index.
        
pca.py - visualize data with PCA

visualization.py - draw the plot

kmeans.py - implementation of K-means

hierarchical.py - implementation of HAC

dbscan.py - implementation of DBSCAN

GMM.py - implementation of GMM

spectral.py - implementation of Spectral clustering


# How to run it

Run Main.py with python, the result will be printed in console.

### Python version: 3.6
